#  TypeRush — Typing Speed Test App  



## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** 🐍 — Core logic and performance tracking  
- **Streamlit** 🌐 — Frontend UI and app framework  
- **Custom CSS** 🎨 — Clean, modern visuals  
- **Lottie Animations** 🎞 — For playful feedback and polish  

**Utility Modules:**  
- `get_text_by_difficulty()` → Dynamic text generator

## 🧠 How It Works

1. You pick a difficulty → App grabs a random passage  
2. Countdown hits zero → Start typing  
3. Hit Enter or click submit → The backend kicks in  
4. It checks:
   - How many characters were correct  
   - How many were off  
   - Time taken → Speed calculated  
5. You get:
   - **WPM**  
   - **Accuracy %**  
   - **Mistakes (visibly highlighted)**

Simple. Fast. Brutally honest.

## ⚡ Final Note ⚡

**Made from scratch. Runs smooth. Kinda proud of it, not gonna lie.**  
Designed, developed, and shipped during the **Internship**, every part of TypeRush was built with intent: from logic to UI to user flow.

It’s not flawless — and that’s the point.  
**It’s real, raw, and evolving.**
