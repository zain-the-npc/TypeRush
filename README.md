#  TypeRush — Typing Speed Test App  


**Think you're fast? Prove it. TypeRush is where speed meets precision.**


## 🧩 What’s the Point?
Typing is something we all do — but how good are we *really*?  
Most typing tools are either boring, clunky, or feel like homework.  
**TypeRush** brings the heat: quick rounds, slick UI, and instant stats to help you level up your typing game — without putting you to sleep.


##More 
**Made from scratch. Runs smooth. Kinda proud of it, not gonna lie.**  
Designed, developed, and shipped during the **Internship**, every part of TypeRush was built with intent: from logic to UI to user flow.


## ✨ Note ✨
It’s not flawless — and that’s the point.  
**It’s real, raw, and evolving.**
